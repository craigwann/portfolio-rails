#### Strengths
1. Work ethic: As exemplified by my perfect attendance record at Epicodus (8 hours a day/40 hours a week) coupled with an additional 30-40 a week driving for Lyft. As a single father this is not easy, however proves I will do what is necessary to accomplish the goals.

1. Attitude and aptitude: the learning process has never stopped and enjoy learning new things. I possess a fun, energetic personality and actually use constructive criticism given to me.


#### Personal Interest & Hobbies
1. I enjoy following along with Bob Ross videos using Procreate app for iPad.
1. Movies: favorite genre being SciFi and fantasy. Top of the list includes Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Ex Machina, RED (Retired Extremely Dangerous).
3. Video games: Top of this list includes Just Cause 3, Borderlands (all), Quake and Doom.
